/**
 *  Listener added to DragAndDropControls to perform the drag start,
 *  drag over, and drop operations.  It is up to the listener on the
 *  source control to allow the drag session to be initiated.  The
 *  listeners on the drop targets can then indicate the status of 
 *  the potential drop, accept the drop, and so on.  Finally, when
 *  the drag is complete, the listener on the drag source is notified
 *  that the operation is done.
 * 
 *  <p>Event lifecycle (in order):</p>
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>SOURCE: onDragDetected() called when the drag gesture is initiated.  
 *  The application provided implementation returns a Draggable if the drag
 *  session should start or null if the drag should not be started.</li>
 *  <li>TARGET: onDragEnter() called when the Draggable is over a new target.</li>
 *  <li>TARGET: onDragOver() called for motion over the target.  The application
 *  provided implementation can set the DragSession's drag status to indicate
 *  whether a drop would succeed or not.</li>
 *  <li>TARGET: onDragExit() called when the Draggable is no longer over this
 *  target</li>
 *  <li>TARGET: onDrop() called when the user releases the drag over this
 *  target.  The application provided implementation can do the steps to move
 *  the data to its new container and has one last chance to indicate failure.</li>
 *  <li>SOURCE: onDragDone() called on the source when the user releases the
 *  drag.  This allows the source to clean itself up and/or return the item
 *  if the drag was unsuccessful.</li>  
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Note: in all cases above, the SOURCE and the TARGET may be the same
 *  container and listeners handle this as appropriate.</p>
